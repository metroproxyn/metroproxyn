### Greetings!👋

I am Aleks Mashanski, a Documentation Developer and System Analyst who is interested in the framework of Cybersecurity and AI. I also have an experience in Coding Practice Challenges and Data Science field.

A lot of my repositories & pet projects represented here, from my school days when I tried Java and C languages to nowadays, where mostly of my projects are related with Python and AI in general.
I'm in relations with Further Mathematics since my secondary school. And I really like the fact that things like Mathematics, Combinatorics, Statistics & Probability Theory can be combined with Programming and generate an interesting result!

In addition, I’m interested in the mathematical aspects of Cryptography, various Cryptographyc Algorithms & Methods.
