### Greetings!üëã

I am Aleks Mashanski, a Documentation Developer who is interested in the framework of Cybersecurity. I also have an experience in Coding Practice Challenges and Artificial Intelligence field.

A lot of my repositories & pet projects represented here, from my school days when I tried Java and C languages to nowadays, where mostly of my projects are related with Python and Data Science in general.
I'm in relations with High Math since my secondary school. And I really like the fact that things like Mathematics, Combinatorics, Statistics & Probability Theory can be combined with Programming and generate an interesting result!

In addition, I‚Äôm interested in the mathematical aspects of Cryptography, various Cryptographyc Algorithms & Methods. I'm trying to do experiments on the application of Cryptographic Techniques in my projects, such as [cryptopyth](https://github.com/metroproxyn/cryptopyth).
